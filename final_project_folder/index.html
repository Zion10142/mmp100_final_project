       <h1>You are not alone.</h1>
        <h2>by Zion Ramphal</h2>
        <h3>You finally convince your parents that you are old enough to stay home alone so they let you stay home for the day while they run errands.</h3>

        <h3>Feeling tired of playing outside you decide to come back in the house but forget to close the door...</h3>

        <h3>Without noticing you've left the door open you go to your room and watch tv.</h3>

        <h3> You hear a loud noise coming from the kitchen area. </h3>

        <h3>Checking the kitchen area you see nothing has fallen and everything seems to look the same, except...</h3>

        <h3>... the refrigerator is open. You take a better look and realize that some things were missing from the fridge. You start to panic, what if someone entered the house? Are they in the house still? Are they watching you right now?</h3>

        <h3>As these thoughts run through your head you hear another noise in the distance and that makes your blood run cold. You yell out "anyone there" reluctantly wishing no one answers. The hallway is dark and whatever was making noise is on the other side of it. You stare down the hallway for a moment before walking further and further down the hallway until you finally goet a clear view of what was at the end of the hallway and it surprises you.</h3>

        <h3>It turns out a cute racoon entered the house when you left the door open, stole some food from your fridge, and decided to make itself at home.</h3>
